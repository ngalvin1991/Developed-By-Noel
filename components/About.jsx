                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">So... I'm Noel and I'm from Croydon in South London.</p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">My web development career has only really just begun after taking a Front-End Web Development
                        course in 2022, but I have loved anything to do with computers since I was little.
                    </p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">Since completing the course I have been progressing my skills further to become a great developer by any means necessary.</p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">Before starting my web developer career, I have worked in various Account Management and Hospitality roles, so I have a great 
                        understanding of what fantastic customer service is, which I feel can push my developer career further.
                    </p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">I studied music production at university and graduated in 2014. I produce my own music and have had a few of my songs played on BBC radio in the past, which was personally a great achievement.</p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">Other than my love for music, I have a great passion for Forumla One and American Football (GO RAIDERS!)</p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">Come with me on my journey to becoming a great web developer and if you wish to throw some ideas my way, please contact me and I'll be happy to make your ideas come to life.</p>
